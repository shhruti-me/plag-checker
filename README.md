Plagiarism / Text Similarity Checker


A Python-based text similarity analyzer that detects potential plagiarism by comparing documents using classical NLP techniques. The project implements text preprocessing, tokenization, character n-gram generation, and similarity scoring using Jaccard and cosine similarity. By combining word-level and n-gram analysis, the system effectively identifies both direct copying and paraphrased content while remaining fully interpretable and free of external ML dependencies.
